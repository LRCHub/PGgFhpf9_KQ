[00:13.69] Let's get real
[00:14.75] What's your deal?
[00:15.56] D'you still believe you
[00:17.21] Will ever
[00:18.19] Be able to take us down?
[00:20.47] Three letters
[00:21.39] On the wall
[00:22.21] L-O-L, you have lost again
[00:24.90] Don't take it too hard
[00:35.90] 
[00:27.12] No surprise
[00:27.99] After all
[00:28.86] You chose the wrong rival
[00:30.52] We are more
[00:31.33] Than some bored teenagers, yeah
[00:33.55] Bad luck, underestimating us was your worse choice
[00:38.20] Don't sweat it, grownups
[00:50.20] 
[00:40.11] Fakers!
[00:41.64] You have no chance, no
[00:42.90] We'll be through with you before you know it
[00:45.24] Too bad, right?
[00:46.92] We came to take ev'ry heart
[00:50.37] Your's included, don't worry
[00:51.41] This is WAR
[00:56.91] 
[00:52.43] Society!
[00:54.62] We'll keep on fighting
[00:56.13] How about looking at things from a new perspective?

[01:02.54] To save the world forever
[01:04.68] This job's to us, yeah
[01:15.68] 
[01:20.21] Time to ask
[01:21.09] Did you get
[01:21.98] A grip on the truth?
[01:23.45] We are here to bring change to our world
[01:26.64] Take a side
[01:27.49] Make it right
[01:28.34] Or get out of the way right NOW
[01:31.11] You cannot stop us
[01:40.11] 
[01:33.49] How many
[01:34.35] Times did you
[01:35.12] Look away that someone
[01:36.62] Cried for help?
[01:37.54] Acting like you didn't know
[01:39.68] We won't accept excuses without sincere actions
[01:44.34] Unmasking all you
[01:52.84] 
[01:46.28] Traitors!
[01:47.74] Don't let this world down
[01:49.24] Say it, you want to change, too
[01:50.99] So why suppress it, huh?
[01:53.39] Why hesitate when there is no rule
[01:55.45] Stopping you? Come on!
[01:57.54] No whining, all you
[02:07.04] 
[01:59.61] Cowards!
[02:00.93] Denying what is right
[02:02.26] It is just easier than to try something new, right?
[02:06.15] This way of living has been oh so
[02:08.05] Comfy all this time
[02:10.70] Still that's no excuse, no!
[02:24.20] 
[02:25.76] Remember
[02:27.40] Every time that you
[02:29.39] Felt alone, nobody there to care
[02:32.76] Let's make it better!
[02:34.28] Be different right now!
[02:36.17] It is your chance to get up
[02:37.62] And welcome a
[02:44.12] 
[02:39.12] New day!
[02:40.67] Embrace the real you
[02:42.16] Face it, you are not like everybody else, right?
[02:45.14] Time to stand up for yourself and all things dear to you
[02:50.66] Time to be a
[02:56.66] 
[02:52.11] World Changer!
[02:53.86] What are you waiting for?
[02:55.38] Don't you turn around and give into old matters, stop!
[02:59.46] You can become the change you've feared all this time
[03:03.55] Be yourself
[03:04.33] We are waiting for you
